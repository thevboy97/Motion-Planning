# Motion-Planning
Implementation of search-based motion planning algorithms such as A* and different variations of A* like ARA*, RTAA*, MTA* for interception of a mobile target. Executed and optimized the performance of the algorithms on various known and unknown maps with different map sizes, robot/target positions and target movement strategies.
